Project: Modelling Inequality in the Future Food System using PLUMv2

Overview: This repository contains all the necessary files and scripts for data analysis, data preparation, and figure generation related to my PhD project "Modelling income inequality in the future food system." This work utilises the PLUMv2 model, for which data and scripts are hosted on gitlabs. Results files which are too large to store on GitHub are hosted on the University of Edinburgh supercomputer cluster, EDDIE. 

Repository Structure:

**data_analysis/:** Contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing data generated from the PLUMv2 model.

**data_preparation/:** Contains scripts for preparing and cleaning raw data for analysis.

**data/:** All raw data files including inputs and results.

**visualisations/:** Contains scripts and code for generating figures and visualizations used in the PhD thesis and intermediate reports.


To run the scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following software and packages installed:

R (version 4.0 or higher)
RStudio (optional, for easier interaction with R scripts and notebooks)
Required R packages:
dplyr
ggplot2
data.table
